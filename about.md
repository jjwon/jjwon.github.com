I build stuff that hopefully makes people's lives better. ᕕ( ᐛ )ᕗ

#### About

I'm currently looking for a new role in healthcare or education software.

Previously, I was at [Operator](https://operator.com), and before that, [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com)) and [UC Berkeley](https://berkeley.edu)).

Some of my interests include learning, photography, fitness, and foreign languages.

Here are some things I'm doing right now.

- I have been taking an online video chat-based Chinese class in order to study the language more efficiently.
- A friend and I have been working on a mobile web app for [Project Homeless Connect](https://projecthomelessconnect.org/), an SF-based nonprofit.
- I'm currently reading [Thinking Fast and Slow](https://smile.amazon.com/Thinking-Fast-Slow-Daniel-Kahneman/dp/0374533555) by Daniel Kahneman. Recently, I finished [Doing Good Better](https://smile.amazon.com/Doing-Good-Better-Effective-Altruism/dp/1592409660) by William MacAskill, from which I learned a lot about the effective altruism movement, and why we should think carefully about what charities we donate to.

#### Projects

Here are some things I've done.

- At Operator, I designed and built an inventory scraper system, launched UberRUSH holiday integration, and hacked on parts of our Facebook Messenger experience.
- At LinkedIn, I revised ETL pipelines to ingest traffic from the new mobile app, and built a web app to prototype data transformation workflows.
- With some spare time after work, I added a feature to one of Khan Academy's open-source projects, [live-editor](https://github.com/Khan/live-editor), and they wrote [a short blog post](http://cs-blog.khanacademy.org/2015/10/new-helpful-messages-for-our-webpage.html) about the work I did.
- When I was a student, I was in a club called [Blueprint](https://calblueprint.org) which built apps for nonprofits. I worked on an Android app to make event check-in electronic instead of on-paper for [Project Homeless Connect](https://projecthomelessconnect.org/), and led a group of deveopers to build a web app to coordinate food recovery efforts for [Food Shift](http://foodshift.net).
- At my first hackathon, my roommate and I built an app to find trending Instagram photos from different locations dubbed [Viewfinder](https://viewfinder.herokuapp.com/). It was the first web app either of us had ever built, and we struggled for pretty much all 24 hours, but it was immensely rewarding.
