I build stuff that hopefully makes people's lives better. ᕕ( ᐛ )ᕗ

#### About

I'm currently an engineer at [Color Genomics](https://www.color.com/). Previously, I was at [Operator](https://operator.com), and before that, [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com) and [UC Berkeley](https://berkeley.edu). A copy of my resume can be found [here]({% link resume.pdf %}).

Some of my interests include learning, fitness, and effective altruism.

Here are some things I'm doing right now.

- I've been working on a [mobile app](https://www.scribe.pizza) to help people journal.
- I'm currently reading [How to Solve It](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_to_Solve_It) by George Pólya. Recently, I finished [The Music of the Primes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Music_of_the_Primes) by Marcus du Sautoy, and [Shoe Dog](https://www.gatesnotes.com/Books/Shoe-Dog) by Phil Knight.

#### Projects

Here are some fun things I've done.

- At Operator, I designed and built a flexible inventory scraper system, launched same-day gifting using UberRUSH, and redesigned and rebuilt the chat app which powers half of Operator.
- At LinkedIn, I built a web app to prototype and execute different data transformation workflows.
- With some spare time after work, I added a feature to one of Khan Academy's open-source projects, [live-editor](https://github.com/Khan/live-editor), and they wrote [a short blog post](http://cs-blog.khanacademy.org/2015/10/new-helpful-messages-for-our-webpage.html) about the work I did.
- When I was a student, I was in a club called [Blueprint](https://calblueprint.org) which built apps for nonprofits. I worked on an Android app to make event check-in electronic instead of on-paper for [Project Homeless Connect](https://projecthomelessconnect.org/), and led a group of deveopers to build a web app to coordinate food recovery efforts for [Food Shift](http://foodshift.net).
- At my first hackathon, my roommate and I built an app to find trending Instagram photos from different locations dubbed [Viewfinder](https://viewfinder.herokuapp.com/). It was the first web app either of us had ever built, and we struggled for pretty much all 24 hours.
