I'm a software engineer, a Golden Bear (Cal '15), a nutrition aficionado, and also a Billboard Top 40 connoisseur.  During the day, I work on the Data Infrastructure team at LinkedIn, mostly revising and building new ETL pipelines.  I also do a little bit of coding outside work, be it learning new frameworks or skills through small projects, or contributing to open source projects.

I have a strong belief that anyone can learn or master any particular skill that they want to, as long as they spend enough time and effort.  This might be in the form of absorbing material, refining skills, or searching for more resources to learn from.  Of course, there's a limit to this, which is that we only have so much time and energy each day, and people do have natural affinities towards certain types of skills.  However, to me, it means that if I really want to be able to do something, I believe that I can.

Since there are only 24 hours in a day, and we only have so many days alive on this ear, I want to build products to empower people to efficiently and effectively achieve any goal they have.  Currently, I think one of the best ways to do this is to provide people with excellent instructional content.

I'm fortunate to have been able to surround myself with incredible individuals during my time at Cal who inspired me to constantly improve myself.  I hope that I can continue on the upwards growth trajectory that I've been on for the last few years.

_When I'm not writing code, you can find me lifting weights or climbing at [Mission Cliffs](https://touchstoneclimbing.com/mission-cliffs/), jamming with friends, taking or editing photos, or eating at new restaurants.  If you find me interesting in any way shape or form, feel free to [email me](mailto:jason.j.won@gmail.com) and we can chat over coffee._
