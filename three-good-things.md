[Three Good Things](http://www.actionforhappiness.org/take-action/find-three-good-things-each-day) is an exercise I decided to start on after being assigned it while taking [GG101x](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:BerkeleyX%2BGG101x-2%2B1T2015/info), a course about the science of happiness offered on [edX](https://edx.org).  More or less, the idea is to list three positive things that happened in your day, and reflect on what caused it and why it made you feel happy.  The motivation is to "notice, remember, and savor the better things in life".  I'm very curious about it and since it only takes about 10 minutes a day, I decided to try it out for a little bit.

### 12/14/14

I haven't been updating this too much in the past few days, which is kind of bad because part of the point of this exercise is to look introspectively into your life and find three good things that happen every day.  However, the past few days both haven't been that great (and I kind of forgot about this).  At this point, I feel like I've actually learned a lot from this short experiment, so I'll try to write something up soon about it.

1.  I spent basically all day today working on my CS 160 final report.  In the end, I'm quite happy with the way it turned out.  I probably could have just done it in Google Docs, Microsoft Word, or something like that, and just called it a day by putting all the requisite content on the page.  But instead I decided to grind it out and draw up the PDF in Adobe Illustrator (argh I really should get InDesign and learn that for things like this...).  Despite it being a big struggle and taking the majority of this day (8+ hours), I think the final result looks pretty great and I'm proud that I stuck through with it, especially since I was really dissatisfied with the quality of the rest of our project (code, presentation, etc).

2.  Sometime this afternoon I got up and stretched, and felt really sore.  It's a nice reminder that (hopefully) working out will pay off dividends.

3.  A friend who I sort of gave up on and pinned as someone who only reaches out when it's necessary or convenient got boba with me.  Maybe I jumped to conclusions a little too fast."

### 12/10/14

1.  Went to sleep and woke up at a reasonable hour!  Slowly getting my sleep schedule back on track feels great because then I can actually be productive and live like a normal person.

2.  Finally fully completed a project that I'm quite proud of.  I thought I was done before, but the results didn't look very good and I was a little confused.  I found out that I had made a mistake, but fixing it and seeing that the results were really great was empowering.

3.  Got dinner with my little!  It's been a long time.

### 12/9/14

1.  Successfully resolved some miscommunications and issues that I had with one of my project groups.  I was a little annoyed and worried that there'd be a lot of conflict, but I was happy that I handled the situation well.

2.  I grabbed dinner with one of my best friends at Berkeley after not having seen him for a while, it was fun to just hang out and chat and talk about how we enjoy being fat sometimes.

3.  I went to the gym and started doing [Ice Cream Fitness](http://www.muscleandstrength.com/workouts/jason-blaha-ice-cream-fitness-5x5-novice-workout) again, after deciding that the split I was doing before wasn't really working as well as I had hoped (not really making significant strength gains and not really getting buffer either).  The first workout was long but a lot of fun, especially since I hadn't been able to go to the gym for a long time.

### 12/6/14

1.  Was able to go watch my younger cousin test for blackbelt this morning.  I was a little disappointed that she hadn't made quite as much progress as I hoped, but it was a lot of fun to watch some taekwondo action again.  I haven't been out of taekwondo for *that* long, in reality, but it feels like it has been forever, and it inspired me to keep working towards my own fitness goals (and made me want to be flexible again...)

2.  Worked out right after, and thinking about things that have transpired recently, I realized again that I really do love working out, and as part of my motion to start doing things for me, not for others, I should really be spending more time at the gym and try to really push myself.  I've gotten pretty comfortable with my routine and I haven't been making that much progress.  It's time to overhaul it a little bit, or just try to deload everything and then go hard again.

3.  Ate some crackers with pepperoni and salami, and it tasted *really* good."

### 12/5/14

1.  Posted a photo I really liked on Instagram, and got a decent amount of positive comments and likes.  I took the photo yesterday impulsively but I thought it had a lot of potential, and when I was editing it yesterday I was able to add a lot of brightness and contrast.  It was really rewarding, because photography (and in general, artsy-crafty things) is something I want to improve at, and positive feedback encourages me to continue shooting.

2.  Got lunch with a friend.  I haven't seen him for a while and it was nice to just hang out and eat some pretty tasty food together.  It just reminded me that connecting with people I like, even if we don't really have much to specifically talk about, is nice.

3.  Went to retreat and had some great chats.  I was really annoyed with having to go to retreat before, because I have been feeling really disconnected with Theta Tau recently.  However, I was more or less forced to go to retreat because I had put my car down as a ride, and the four people I was supposed to drive would have no way to get there if I didn't drive.  I was kind of an asshole during the ride up because I didn't really want to go.  However, when I got there, I really enjoyed talking to some people, a few of them who I normally wouldn't have any long or meaningful conversation with.  It made me realize that though I don't really believe in what the fraternity does, I can still believe in the quality and goodness of some of the members.
