_In the end of 2016, I decided to leave Operator and join something new. This series of posts will cover my process and corresponding thoughts going through the job search, this time as a junior software engineer._

I've looked for full-time software engineering roles twice in the past, the first time being when I graduated college, and the second time when I was preparing to leave LinkedIn after a short stint on their data warehousing team. In retrospect, both of these searches were relatively similar due to what I was looking for (somewhere I could grow into a competent engineer), and the experience I had (basically none).

This third time, I looked for opportunities specifically in the realms of healthcare and education, had a little bit of experience, and a little bit more confidence in my engineering skills.
