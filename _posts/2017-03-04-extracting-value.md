I recently came upon a [post](https://zachholman.com/posts/extracting-value) by Zach Holman about extracting value as an employee, and thought it would be a great follow-up to my [previous discussion]({% post_url 2017-02-24-pedigree %}) on evaluating a job offer based on future opportunities.

Zach's post makes a few key points. Firstly, an employer-employee relationship is business, but other relationships within a job, like coworker-coworker or manager-worker, are personal. Therefore, building great relationships and being a passionate, hard worker are not conditional on pledging your life to your company. Secondly, if you have future plans or aspirations, your job can and should be a vehicle to move you farther along that pass. Your job takes up a lot of your time; therefore, you should try to get as much mileage from it as possible.

Now, in case you didn't read it yet, [read his post](https://zachholman.com/posts/extracting-value).
