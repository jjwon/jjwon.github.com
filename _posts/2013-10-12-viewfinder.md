Viewfinder was a short hack for a hackathon held last year at Facebook.  It was my first hackathon, and also the first time that I had ever built anything somewhat big that wasn't for school.  My friend and I built a simple web app that allows people to check out interesting Instagram photos from different locations.

The entire experience was awesome, despite us having _tons_ of difficulties doing the simplest things, like hosting our web app on Heroku, due to our inexperience.  In the end, although the project is certainly not very complete nor clean (there's literally a committed merge conflict in the README that displays on the GitHub repository), it was extremely powerful to know that we had the ability to come up with an interesting idea and actually turn it into a reality.  It was an experience that made me truly realize how powerful computer science is.

The Heroku app still works!  Check it out [here](http://viewfinder.herokuapp.com/).  And see our (poor) code [here](https://github.com/jjwon/Viewfinder).

Some months later, my friends actually sent me links of [other](http://worldc.am/) websites which did the same thing we did (after we did, I'd like to mention!) but much more cleanly.  However, it's nice to think that we might have been first on an actual good idea.
