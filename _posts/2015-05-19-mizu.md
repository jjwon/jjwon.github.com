The idea for this project came from some friends over from UCSF: some people have a condition where they can only drink a limited amount of water in one day. It can be hard for patients to keep track of how much water they drank over the course of a day, despite it being critical to their health. To solve this problem, I worked with five others from [Innovative Design](http://innovativedesign.club/) over a little less than half of a semester to design and create a product to help people measure how much water they are consuming a day.

Our solution was a little device dubbed "Mizu" which attaches onto the bottom of whatever water bottle you normally use. Inside a Mizu, there is a circuitboard powered by a coin-cell chip containing a capacitor converter, accelerometer, and a Bluetooth low-energy chip. We fabricated a capacitor with parallel plates and foam in-between, which fit neatly in our custom housing. The accelerometer helps determine whether the bottle is at rest or not (whether water has just been consumed, so we can update), and the capacitor helps us determine precisely how much water has been consumed, since the capacitance will be proportional to the weight of the bottle, which is proportional to the water left in the bottle. Finally, we have an accompanying phone app built using [Ionic](http://ionicframework.com/) and powered by [Parse](https://parse.com/).  I built a large portion of this app.

Interestingly enough, after our demo day at the end of the semester, we found [many](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/582920317/hidrateme-smart-water-bottle?ref=category_popular) [similar](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/905031711/trago-the-worlds-first-smart-water-bottle) [products](https://www.h2opal.com/?ref=producthunt), although most of these initially intended to help owners consume _more_ water a day for health reasons.
