[Food Shift](http://foodshift.net/) is a nonprofit based in Oakland which works collaboratively with communities, businesses, and government entities to try and develop long-term, sustainable solutions to reduce food waste.  I led a project team consisting of four others from [Cal Blueprint](http://calblueprint.org) to build an web app which could pair small-scale donors (such as companies who frequently have a lot of extra food after catered events) with local organizations equipped to distribute extra food to the needy.

Food Shift did not have any existing mechanism that we were replacing &mdash; we were building a new feature for them that could leverage their large network of food recovery organizations to make use of these small-scale donors.  The app allows potential food donors to easily and efficiently set up one-time or recurring food donations and potential food recipients to find out and sign up for food donations.  A high-level coordinator from Food Shift can pair donors and recipients together so food can be effectively exchanged.

Food Shift wasn't a new project when I took over as the project leader; it was a project being continued from the last semester.  Since I didn't work on the project the previous semester, I had to play a lot of catch-up in terms of understanding the code base (made additionally difficult because I didn't know Rails) and getting to know our nonprofit coordinator and what she wanted out of our project.  One especially hard thing for me in the beginning was setting deadlines on tasks I assigned to our developers; since I didn't know Rails until I started working on this project, I wasn't sure what were manageable deadlines.  However, it worked out okay in the end.  Actually, my biggest difficulties with this project ended up being largely non-technical: things like making our meetings and work sessions effective, getting my developers to finish their tasks on time, and trying to stay on the same page with our coordinator in terms of the scale and scope of the project.

Unfortunately, this project is will likely not go into production due to some communcation issues about the spec, but hopefully it can be of use to Food Shift as a prototype for what a donor/recipient platform could look like.  I learned a ridiculous amount about managing a project team, working with clients, and Rails, and am extremely grateful to my four developers and our client Dana, despite the project not working out quite as planned.
