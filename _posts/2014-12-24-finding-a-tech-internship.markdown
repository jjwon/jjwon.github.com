## Introduction

Finding a tech internship can be daunting if you have not done it before.  This post is meant to try and elucidate what to do, what to expect, and how to succeed.

Essentially, the entire process can be broken down into two parts: **getting interviews**, and **getting offers**.  The first step includes things such as resumes, career fairs, and referrals.  The second step includes phone interviews and in-person interviews.  This post will cover the first step.

## The Resume

Typically, there are three main ways to reach out to companies about internships: applying online, going to an infosession/career fair, and asking an employee or former intern to refer you.  All of these require a resume.

[There](http://how-to-write-a-resume.org/) [is](https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/719/1/) [a](http://career-advice.monster.com/resumes-cover-letters/resume-writing-tips/how-to-write-a-resume/article.aspx) [lot](http://rockportinstitute.com/resumes/) of advice on the internet about how to write a resume.  However, a lot of information is outdated and/or irrelevant to those working in tech, and is not necessarily targeted towards undergraduate students.  A couple tips:

#### General Formatting

* Objectives are unnecessary.  It's pretty obvious that you want a job.
* Your resume should be (easily) condensed into one page.
* Make sure your name is really big on your resume.  Make it easy for people to find who you are.

#### Education

* Include your GPA if it's higher than a 3.0.  If you omit your GPA, recruiters will assume it's low.
* Don't list all your classes if you've taken a lot; pick and choose the important ones.  And when listing classes, don't include a lot of information about each of your courses &ndash; title will suffice.

#### Experience and Projects

* Describe both what your project accomplished and the technologies you leveraged.
* Use strong verbs to describe what you did specifically.
* Use bullet points so recruiters can quickly skim your resume.

#### Skills

* Don't include Microsoft Office, operating systems, etc.  This is just fluff.
* Consider breaking apart your skills into groups based on proficiency.  This way, if you're a Python hacker but you're currently learning how to make iOS apps, recruiters can easily infer this.

You can write your resume in whatever you want, but make sure that if you're submitting them electronically, save them as a pdf file.  Typically people will use Microsoft Word or LaTeX.  If you're applying for a design role, you may consider using InDesign to make your resume a little more pretty.  Here are a couple of templates that I like: [mine](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/em9ie8634fcklh7/AABowh7E8EA8u-AcXulz5Rqua?dl=0) ([output](https://www.dropbox.com/s/bxwcrumrhm7swwu/resume.pdf?dl=0)), [simple one from RPI](http://www.rpi.edu/dept/arc/training/latex/resumes/res9b.tex) ([output](http://www.rpi.edu/dept/arc/training/latex/resumes/res9b.pdf)), [a pretty two-column one](http://www.latextemplates.com/template/deedy-resume-cv).

*But wait! I have nothing interesting to put on my resume!*

Well, fear not, most of us are like that.  You can always start by describing some of your school projects, activities at school, and maybe prior work experience which might not be all-too-related.  [Here's](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ntyeqe4dldl17cm/yue_resume.pdf?dl=0) one of my old resumes.  It doesn't have very much relevant information, but it's not awful.  As you make more interesting things, you can rotate less relevant things out of your resume.

## Getting in contact with companies

As previously mentioned, there are three main ways to get in touch with people who will hire you: online applications, career fairs, and referrals.

### Referrals

Of these three, referrals are by far the best option.  If you are interested in a company and know of people who worked/work there, **ask for a referral**.  Referrals let you skip the the most crapshoot part of the recruiting process (getting your resume selected from a huge pool) and allow you to go straight to interviewing.  Typically recruiters will contact referrals much faster as well, meaning less work and less stress for you.

### Infosessions/Career Fairs

If you cannot get a referral, your next best option is to go to a company infosession or a career fair.  At UC Berkeley, there are typically somewhere between one to three large-scale career fairs every semester, and dozens of company infosessions sprinkled through the semester.  There is usually some sort of listing or schedule for these events; at Berkeley, this is on the [EECS Calendar](http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/).

At infosessions, usually there will either be representatives who will be either be collecting resumes in a large pile, or whom you can chat with for a little and then pass off your resume.  Infosessions tend to have free food, and occasionally an interesting talk or presentation.  Just go, drop off your resume, eat some food, and hang out for a bit.

Career fairs are usually much less pleasant.  They typically take place in a large auditorium or a gymnasium, and are packed full of company booths and streams of students.  You will typically have the same conversation with many recruiters after standing in line behind other disgruntled students.  It will be hot and crowded inside.  There are two important things to remember about career fairs.  Firstly, bring a lot of resumes and get there early (if there's any day you should skip class, career fair day is a good one).  Secondly, for companies you are most interested in, try to bring along some interesting and specific questions, since it's already quite hard to stand out.

For both of these, recruiters will rank you/your resume based on strength.  An example scale would be from 1 &ndash; 5, with 5 being a must-interview.  Some factors that can make you stand out are a high GPA, interesting projects, and previous work experience at top companies.

### Online Applications

If you are unable to chat with a company at a career fair or an infosession for whatever reason (there aren't very many good reasons), you can resort to applying online.  There are two ways you can apply online.  The first way is through your school's career center website &ndash; usually there will be some sort of job board with listings, and you can submit resumes to these listings.  This is preferable to the second way, which is submitting an application through the company jobs website.

The reason that online applications are not preferred is because recruiters are already very busy with the people they are interacting with from infosessions and career fairs, so the online application pool is sort of a second-choice pool.  In addition, some online job websites are atrocious, requiring you to do a lot of annoying and unnecessary work, like creating accounts and uploading different files.  [Amazon Jobs](http://amazon.jobs) is a particularly confusing and poorly designed example.

In the end, apply online if necessary but try your best to avoid it.  Applying online lumps you in a large, very generic pool, which tends to be very disadvantageous for you, especially if you're already part of a strong network such as a university.

## Next steps

Keep in mind that job hunting is a numbers game.  Especially if you don't have too much programming experience (freshmen, sophomores), you will probably get rejected a lot.  *That's okay.*  Just keep trying, and you will...

get an interview!  Stay posted for the next post in this sequence, which will go over what to expect in the interview process and how to succeed.
