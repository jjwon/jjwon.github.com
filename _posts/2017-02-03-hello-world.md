I'm starting a blog here, which I expect will be a permanent fixture of my website (as permanent as a 23 year old can imagine right now). There are two main reasons:

- I do have thoughts that I think are interesting and worth sharing, but they only ever really make it to a few people I talk to often.
- I'm generally bad at conveying my thoughts (both in conversation and in writing), and I think an effective way for me to improve would be to practice more.

I expect that most of my posts, if they actually materialize, will be around programming, cognitive science, or fitness. These are the topics I usually think about the most. However, materializing thoughts on these topics may be (will certainly be) harder than expected.
