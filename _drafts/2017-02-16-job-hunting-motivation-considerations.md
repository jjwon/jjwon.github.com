_In the end of 2016, I decided to leave Operator and join something new. This series of posts will cover my process and corresponding thoughts going through the job search, this time as a junior software engineer._

Successful change requires an equal dose of motivation, and searching for a new job is no different. It felt a little different this time, though, since I had been working at Operator for less than two year at this point. Here were some of the reasons I joined Operator:

- An amazing team. The team was very strong, as evidenced by their backgrounds pre-Operator, but also was full of people I felt like I could easily make friends with, people that I'd want to hang out with outside of work.
- A product in a really interesting new market which seemed to be aligned with current tech trends. At that time, Operator was a personal concierge service, which could get you anything you wanted at any time, which was well-aligned with Silicon Valley's shift towards mobile and messaging being the primary ways of interaction. Additionally, machine learning had been growing increasingly popular, so chatbots became increasingly popular. For example, Facebook's developer conference in 2016 featured their new Messenger chatbot platform. Operator's product heavily featured AI which could semi-automatically complete your requests.
- An interest in startups. One of the reasons I was leaving LinkedIn was that politics had made it tough for me to switch onto a team where I would be much more productive, and I wanted no more of that.
- A great opportunity to grow as an engineer. I wanted to learn about building products across the stack, and the small team at Operator meant that I'd have a chance to contribute everywhere.

When I considered leaving, I realized that some of these reasons were no longer quite as true.

- The team was still amazing, but a few of the people I knew had left for other ventures.
- For many good reasons, the product had shifted from a chatbot-powered commerce app to a cross-border, traditional commerce app focused primarily on selling goods to China. The chat feature was still alive and kicking, but the primary feature of the product was now specifically well-priced access to genuine American goods. From a business standpoint, this was a great decision, but this also meant that the product was not something that I felt particularly connected to.
- My primary interest shifted from my personal growth as an engineer towards my social impact I'm making with my career. Material like [80,000 Hours](https://80000hours.org/) and [Doing Good Better](https://www.amazon.com/Doing-Good-Better-Effective-Altruism/dp/1592409660) made me consider how I could utilize my career to make positive social impact, something that I originally thought of as just a way to make money.

The latter became the driving force. Though I still found Operator to be an interesting project, especially since the Chinese tech scene is growing at a rate that's similar to Silicon Valley a few years ago, I decided that I wanted to work on something more close to my heart, and decided to focus specifically on companies in the healthcare and education spaces. As former bioengineer who had originally aspired to be a doctor, healthcare was a space which I felt aligned with. Similarly, as a graduate of a large state university, where some of my classes had over a thousand enrolled students, I was interested in how to personalize education and provide students with equal resources.

With this in mind, my considerations were:

- A company with a social mission very much aligned with my personal missions.
- A company specifically working in the areas of healthcare and education. This was a somewhat arbitrary hard filter; it's tough to rank your own personal missions among each other, but I knew these were ones important to me, so to make the searching process easier, I decided to make this a requisite condition early on.
- An amazing team where I could find both friends and mentors.
- Satisfactory compensation.
