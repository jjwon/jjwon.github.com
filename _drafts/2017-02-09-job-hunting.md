In the beginning of December 2016, I made a concrete decision to leave Operator, effective at the end of January 2017. This decision was motivated by a few things: 

- Operator had pivoted both in terms of product and in terms of target demographic. When I joined in 2015, our product was a concierge service. Slowly, as we worked on the unit economics and product-market fit, we ended up with a personal shopping service for customers globally, to enable borderless commerce. Our first market to tackle here was China.
- I slowly accrued some confidence in my engineering skills, after working on a host of different projects across the stack at Operator.
- My friends working on sectors with a stronger social mission repeatedly inspired me with the impact of the products they were creating.

The combination of these factors made me feel that it was time to put my newfound engineering skills to the task of fixing problems I've been passionate about through college. Leaving was a tough decision to make, especially given that I had a lot of things I still wanted to do at Operator and that I had a lot of friends I would miss dearly there. However, I felt that it was time.

Quickly I re-learned the problems that job seekers face:

- demonstrating that they're competent
- finding compatible companies

Both of these are very serious problems for job seekers. The former is particularly tough for those who are working at startups that have not yet had a lot of traction, simply due to a lack of pedigree. For example, one previous variation of my resume excluded my short three month stint at LinkedIn, and I didn't make it past the application phase at Lyft, despite having a friend refer me. This let me to promptly add back that job, even though its presence indicated nothing other than me previously being able to secure a job at LinkedIn.

I later found that both of these of these can be greatly ameliorated by having a great network. A network can help connect you with interesting opportunities and validate your skills through recommendations and referrals. Tapping your network does a lot of good overall. When it come to the seeker, opportunities that come through your network already have had one pass of validation, making them much more worthwhile to investigate, and usually come with some validation of your skills. It also presents an opportunity to strengthen bonds that already exist. Of the three final companies involved in my job hunt this time around, two of them were opportunities that I wouldn't have been aware of if it wasn't for people in my network.

I was looking for a combination of the following things in my search:

- A company that was strongly mission-driven, operating in either the healthcare or education spaces. This was my only hard filter. Although there are companies with a strong social impact working in other spaces, I decided that for now, I wanted to filter on my own personal bias in addition.
- A company with people I enjoy being around.
- A company with a concrete and sensible business plan. This is something that sounds obvious but hasn't really received appropriate attention until the recent contraction of the tech bubble. Not until I had the chance to chatting with a friend of a friend about edtech and more generally, making a social impact with tech, did this really click. [Josh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/josh-wiseman-97b50028) decided to work in edtech after seeing Facebook grow enormously, and joined Remind and Alt School afterwards. Remind is a great company which makes a product that has had great traction in the classroom thus far, being really popular with teachers and students, but has raised a lot of venture capital, and doesn't really have a great monetization plan. They acquired lots of users, but the product is a simple wrapper over SMS -- it's not something that isn't reproducible nor something that has a clear monetization plan. The combination of these two factors means that now they're bleeding out slowly, and unless they are able to correct their course, they will die out, and won't be able to continue their great impact on classrooms thus far. The conclusion here is that the social impact a company can make is directly tied to the stability and lifeline of the company itself. A company pushing up daisies cannot help anyone.
- A diverse company. For now, I'm an engineer, and love building things. However, I'm not sure what's the best way for me to contribute to a venture; perhaps I'm actually more effective as a manager, or a product designer, or as a salesperson. A diverse company can give me exposure to different things.
