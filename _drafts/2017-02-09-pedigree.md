There are many considerations to take into account when looking for a new job -- location, compensation, the type of work you'd be doing, etc. One consideration which is a more future-thinking is how the new job will set you up for opportunities later down the line.

The most direct way one job can open the door for others is by providing pedigree, since working at a well-known company usually portrays you as a capable individual by proxy. For example, if I see that an engineer has worked at Google, I know that they are probably quite skilled, since Google is known to have a high bar when it comes to engineering. Whether you're applying to a position or recruiters are looking for talent to join them, having pedigree will make you more attractive. Though this may be different from your appraisal or even an outsider's appraisal of your skills, it's still a funnel you'll need to go through.

An less common, but equally effective way is by growing and strengthening your network. Though it's certainly common for both applicants to find a job via online application and for recruiters to find talent through cold emails, reaching out cold usually has a poor success rate. Reaching out across a connection through your network has much better success; for example, if you reached out to a project partner from college, or if an old coworker listed your name in a sourcing jam. The presence of an advocate provides additional validation to both parties, since applicants know more about the opportunity, and recruiters know that someone can vouch for the applicant -- a better experience across the board. 

Therefore, when considering a new opportunity, keep in mind not only how it will look on your resume for later on, but also who you might meet, because these people may become advocates for you later down the line.
