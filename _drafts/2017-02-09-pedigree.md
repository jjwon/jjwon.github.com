There are many considerations to take into account when looking for a new job -- location, compensation, the type of work you'd be doing, etc. One important consideration, which requires a bit of foresight and imagination, is how the new job will set you up for opportunities you're interested in later down the line.

One direct way a job can open the door for others is by providing pedigree. Having well-known companies on your resume portrays you as a capable individual by proxy. For example, if I see that an engineer has worked at Google, I know that they are probably quite smart, since Google is known to have a high bar when it comes to engineering. Whether you're applying for a job at a company (outbound) or recruiters are looking for talent to join them (inbound), pedigree makes you a more attractive candidate. If you feel that your pedigree doesn't do your skills justice, it's up to you to make up for it another way. The onus is on you to prove yourself.

A less common, but perhaps even more effective way is by growing and strengthening your network. Though it's certainly common for both applicants to find a job via online application and for recruiters to find talent through cold emails, reaching out cold usually has a poor success rate. It's much easier to get in touch with someone if you have a mutual connection than to do it cold. I've been fortunate to find opportunities through people from organizations I was part of in college, project partners from classes, and old coworkers.

The presence of an advocate provides additional validation to both parties. Applicants have an reasonably unbiased avenue to learn more about the opportunity, as well as inherent knowledge that this opportunity was both exciting and fitting enough for this person to bring it up to you. Recruiters know that someone can vouch for the applicant. It's plainly a better experience across the board. 

Even more importantly, your network can help you find fantastic opportunities that you might have not even known existed. For example, I probably wouldn't have heard about [Color](https://www.color.com) if it weren't for [Gilad](https://www.linkedin.com/in/giladmishne), a former coworker, nor would I have gotten in touch with then if it weren't for [Justin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/justin-wang-24394a13), a friend from college who referred me as part of a company source jam. 

My experience is not unique, and others far more interesting than me give similar advice. [Breakout List](https://breakoutlist.com), a great resource for finding high-growth opportunities, [notes that](https://breakoutlist.com/#ambition-list) you should be looking for opportunities where you can get exposure to lots of information as well as ambitious, smart people. [Elad Gil](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eladgil), a serial founder and investor, [notes that](http://blog.eladgil.com/2015/03/career-decisions.html) particularly in Silicon Valley, networks of the people tend to work together on multiple occasions, making finding a successful crowd a disproportionately large indicator of future success.

Therefore, when considering a new opportunity from this lens, keep in mind not only how it will look on your resume for later on, but also who you might meet. In the end, a huge part of building great productis great people, so try your best to find them.
