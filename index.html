          <h4>About</h4>

          <p>Currently at <a href="https://operator.com">Operator</a>, previously at <a href="https://linkedin.com">LinkedIn</a>, and before that, I studied at <a href="https://berkeley.edu">UC Berkeley</a>.</p>

          <p>Some of my interests include learning, fitness, and foreign languages.</p>

        <div class="content-block work">
          <h4>Work</h4>

          <ul>
            <li>At Operator, I launched <a href="https://operator.com">the new website</a>, UberRUSH holiday integration, and our Facebook Messenger experience.</li>

            <li>At LinkedIn, I revised ETL pipelines to ingest traffic from the new mobile app, and built a web app to prototype data transformation workflows.</li>

            <li>When I was a student, I was in a club called <a href="https://calblueprint.org">Blueprint</a> which built apps for nonprofits. I worked on an Android app to make event check-in electronic instead of on-paper for <a href="https://projecthomelessconnect.org/">Project Homeless Connect</a>, and led a group of deveopers to build a web app to coordinate food recovery efforts for <a href="https://foodshift.net">Food Shift</a>.</li>

            <li>I still love the first side project I ever built, which was for my first hackathon. It's an app to find trending Instagram photos from different locations dubbed <a href="http://viewfinder.herokuapp.com/">Viewfinder</a>. My friend and I struggled for pretty much all 24 hours, but it was immensely rewarding.</li>
