<h1 class="landing-text">Hi, I'm Jason.</h1>

<p>
I'm a 4th year student at UC Berkeley studying Electrical Engineering and Computer Science.  As a software engineer, my interests lie somewhere around the space of efficient algorithms, UI/UX design, and machine learning.  I'm really passionate about making a positive impact on other peoples' lives, and helping them be the best version of themselves.  On the internet, I usually go by jjwon, or something like that.
</p>

<p>
Outside of class, I work for <a href="http://rescomp.berkeley.edu">Residential Computing</a>, am a developer for <a href="http://calblueprint.org">Blueprint, Technology for Nonprofits</a>, and am an active brother in <a href="http://calthetatau.com">Theta Tau</a>.  When I have free time, I enjoy looking through a camera lens, getting lost in books, indulging my stomach, and playing frisbee.
