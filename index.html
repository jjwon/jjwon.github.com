          <h4>About</h4>

          <p>Currently at <a href="https://operator.com">Operator</a>, previously at <a href="https://linkedin.com">LinkedIn</a>, and before that, at <a href="https://berkeley.edu">UC Berkeley</a>.</p>

          <p>Some of my interests include learning, photography, fitness, and foreign languages.</p>

          <p>Here are some things I'm doing right now.</p>

          <ul>
            <li>At Operator, I've been recently overhauling our website in preparation for a rebranding of our product.</li>

            <li>My roommate and I have been developing on a web app to help you view and organize your finances.</li>

            <li>I recently started taking an online video chat-based Chinese class in order to study the language more efficiently.</li>

            <li>
              I'm currently reading <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Thinking-Fast-Slow-Daniel-Kahneman/dp/0374533555">Thinking Fast and Slow</a> by Daniel Kahneman.
              Recently, I finished <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Three-Body-Problem-Cixin-Liu/dp/0765382032">The Three Body Problem</a> by Cixin Liu, which I loved.
          </ul>

        <div class="content-block work">
          <h4>Projects</h4>

          <p>Here are some things I've done.</p>

          <ul>
            <li>At Operator, I launched <a href="https://operator.com">the new website</a>, UberRUSH holiday integration, and our Facebook Messenger experience.</li>

            <li>At LinkedIn, I revised ETL pipelines to ingest traffic from the new mobile app, and built a web app to prototype data transformation workflows.</li>

            <li>With some spare time after work, I added a feature to one of Khan Academy's open-source projects, <a href="https://github.com/Khan/live-editor">live-editor</a>, and they wrote <a href="http://cs-blog.khanacademy.org/2015/10/new-helpful-messages-for-our-webpage.html">a short blog post</a> about the work I did.</li>

            <li>When I was a student, I was in a club called <a href="https://calblueprint.org">Blueprint</a> which built apps for nonprofits. I worked on an Android app to make event check-in electronic instead of on-paper for <a href="https://projecthomelessconnect.org/">Project Homeless Connect</a>, and led a group of deveopers to build a web app to coordinate food recovery efforts for <a href="http://foodshift.net">Food Shift</a>.</li>

            <li>At my first hackathon, my roommate and I built an app to find trending Instagram photos from different locations dubbed <a href="https://viewfinder.herokuapp.com/">Viewfinder</a>. It was the first web app either of us had ever built, and we struggled for pretty much all 24 hours, but it was immensely rewarding.</li>
