## Using Jekyll

I built this site using [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll), a static blog generator.  Github Pages integrates really easily with it, so you can deploy your branch without even having to track the compiled website.  You can write content in Markdown and mix in HTML if you need to, as well.
