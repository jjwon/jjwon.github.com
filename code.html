  <h3>Fake Miniaturization</h3>

  <img class="img-responsive center-block" src="/assets/images/waterfall-mini.jpg">

  <p>
  This was one of the choices for a final project for my <a href="http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs194-26/fa14/">computational photography class</a>.  It was particularly interesting to me because I used to adore this effect, and have built my own <a href="http://cow.mooh.org/projects/tiltshift/diyexamples.html">ghetto tilt-shift lenses</a> in the past.
  </p>

  <p>Doing this in Matlab is slightly different.  The user draws a box for the focus region, and this part stays in focus.  From here, there are two approaches.  The first one blurs the rest of the image in bands corresponding to the distance from the focus region.  The second (more intelligent) way blurs the image corresponding to a rudimentary depth map, and blurs things that have a different depth (where depths have been binned).  The pieces are then blended together using a Gaussian mask.

  <h3>Project Homeless Connect</h3>

  <img class="img-responsive center-block" src="/assets/images/phc.png">

  <p>
  <a href="http://www.projecthomelessconnect.com/">Project Homeless Connect</a> is a nonprofit in San Francisco which hosts public events for the 75,000 homeless in San Francisco, where they can get social and medical services.  I'm working with four others from <a href="http://calblueprint.org">Cal Blueprint</a> to build an Android app to make the events that they host more efficient by decreasing registration time, preventing loss of sensitive information, and eliminating post-event data entry.

  <h3>Portkey</h3>

  <p>
  Portkey is a optimization tool I built while I was an intern at LinkedIn during summer 2014.  A lot of people on my team would create workflows to move metrics data from sources like Kafka onto a Hadoop server, perform some transformations on it, and then store it into a database to query it and update the company dashboard easily.  However, the scheduling software used to write workflows had a poor interface, which made writing workflows take an extremely long time.  I built a better user-interface with autocompletion, intelligent parameter passing, and saved workflows, decreasing workflow composition time by more than 90%.

  <h3>RapCloud</h3>

  <p>
  RapCloud was a short hack for this summer's LinkedIn Hacker Games.  My friend and I wrote a scraper for rap lyrics, then processed them with a Python script to figure out the most common words and phrases they used, and displayed the data in a word cloud.  It was pretty entertaining.

  <h3>Viewfinder</h3>

  <img class="img-responsive center-block" src="/assets/images/viewfinder.png">

  <p>
  Viewfinder was a short hack for a hackathon held last year at Facebook.  It was my first hackathon!  My friend and I built a simple web-app that allows people to check out interesting Instagram photos from different locations.
