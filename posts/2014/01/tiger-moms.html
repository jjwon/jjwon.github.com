<h1>Why Americans don't like Tiger Moms</h1>

<article>
	<p><img alt="book" src="/images/tiger_mother.jpg" /></p>
<p>Amy Chua's <em>Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother</em> was a highly controversial book that generated an <a href="http://www.aei-ideas.org/2011/01/amy-chua-bludgeons-entire-generation-of-sensitive-parents-bless-her/">enormous</a> <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/ideas-market/2011/01/13/the-tiger-mother-responds-to-readers/">critical</a> <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/18/opinion/18brooks.html?_r=0">reception</a>.  Recently, she's come back into the limelight with her new novel <em>The Triple Package</em>, which is shaping up to be a similar media sensation.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago, I had the opportunity to speak to a group of parents on an Asian alumni panel at my old high school.  One of the topics that was discussed was about parenting: what we thought worked, what we wish we experienced, what we would do when we were parents.  This generated a lot of conversation and there was a wide range of opinions on the panel.  We all agreed that it's important to help your kids to cultivate some sort of passion, such as music or sports.  An emphasis on hard work and success is also crucial.</p>
<p>However, discussing how to nurture success gave birth to a discussion of parenting style.  One extreme is what Amy Chua mentions: never settling for less than the best.  Her girls "were never allowed ... not to be the #1 student in every subject except gym and drama".  However, some of the panelists felt that such a results-oriented approach incurred unnecessary stress and anxiety on kids.  As Chua mentioned in the <a href="http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052748704111504576059713528698754">Wall Street Journal article</a> that brought her fame, "Western parents are extremely anxious about their children's self-esteem".  Parents struggle between worrying about their children's academic and extracurricular success and their ego and self-image.</p>
<p>I'm not quite sure which parenting model is the best.  I grew up in a household with parents who had a bizarre mixture between American and Chinese parenting styles (using Chua's definitions).  Of course I had to get straight A's, play piano well, and succeed in whatever other way that my parents wanted.  However, this is much more lax compared to the #1 in every subject that Chua talks about, and the national competition-level piano skills that her daughter Sophia attained.  Since I didn't suffer <em>too</em> much trouble attaining these goals, I had a lot of free time to browse the internet, play video games, and in general waste a lot of time.  For multiple points during high school in particular, I had over 40 hours of Counter Strike and Team Fortress 2 logged every two weeks.  During this time, I practiced probably 30 minutes to 1 hour of piano a day tops.  I wasn't too stressed, and felt fairly relaxed.</p>
<p>However, in retrospect, I wish that my parents were more aggressive and pushy.  After meeting so many talented individuals in college, I realized that I really wasn't quite as awesome or successful as I thought I was.  Chua mentions in the <a href="http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052748704111504576059713528698754">same article</a> that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>...the Chinese believe that the best way to protect their children is by preparing them for the future, letting them see what they're capable of, and arming them with skills, work habits and inner confidence that no one can take away.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I know that if I had pushed myself hard during high school &mdash; putting more time into piano, doing other extracurriculars, and trying to go above and beyond in academics &mdash; I wouldn't have this distinct lack of confidence in college.  Setting my sights higher earlier in life may have led to more suffering and hardship, but what doesn't kill you makes you stronger.  But kids are inherently lazy, and it's not easy to get them to do things.</p>
<p>Honestly, being a Tiger Mom is <em>hard</em>.  It's an extremely frustrating and aggravating process.  It isn't easy to force your kids to be successful, because success is built off of hard work and failure.  Kids will certainly resist such action, because when you are frustrated and tired, there are a million things that sound more fun than doing more algebra problems, running a few more sprints, or hammering out another dozen scales.</p>
<p>In middle school my mom tried to force me to practice piano more.  She timed me, would incessantly remind me, wouldn't let me play games or go on the computer until I was done, and suffered through all my excuses.  She managed to keep it up for the better part of a year.  But doing this every day for two kids is honestly exhausting and stressful for the parent.  In addition, without any musical background, all she could really do was get me to the piano bench and hope that I was playing things well.  Eventually, she just got tired of putting in so much time and effort to make me practice every day, and I don't blame her.</p>
<p>Chinese parents will do anything and everything in their power to make their kids successful &mdash; contrary to popular belief, if you try hard enough, you can take a horse to water <em>and</em> make it drink.</p>
