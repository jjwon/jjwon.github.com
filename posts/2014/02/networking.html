<h1>Not going solo</h1>

<article>
	<p>My roommate recently has been having a little trouble finding an internship for this summer.  He is an intelligent, hardworking, and motivated student.  Wanting to help him, I suggested that he email me his resume so I could forward it to the recruiter at the company I'm working for this summer.  But he declined, citing that doing so didn't feel fair.</p>
<p>I can't for the life of me understand why doing this would be unfair.  I tried to explain to him my thoughts.  Recruiters are paid to pair high-caliber candidates with empty job positions.  If I know a person who wants work, and a person who wants talent, then what is unfair about me trying to facilitate dialogue between them?</p>
<p>I think one reason is that people don't like to "rely" on other people.  We all have this desire to try and make it on our own, to be our own boss.My roommate probably doesn't want to owe me anything, or to think that he wasn't capable enough to find an internship by himself.  But I feel that this is a flawed mindset.</p>
<p>Firstly, asking someone for a favor isn't as big of an inconvenience as most perceive.  Contrarily, people who do favors for you tend to be more readily approachable or friendly to you; this psychological finding has been dubbed the Benjamin Franklin effect, and has made its way into plenty of self-help books.</p>
