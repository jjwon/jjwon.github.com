<h1>On a quest to be perfect</h1>

<article>
	<p>Something clicked in my head recently.  Success is largely achieved through struggle, hard work, and a lot of effort.  So, <em>theoretically</em>, we can become the perfect people we want to be, right?</p>
<p>I use the term perfect a little loosely, because everyone's notion of "perfection" is different.  My notion of perfection includes traits like attractiveness, intelligence, creativity, and sociability.  Other people may have differing opinions, but you get the idea.</p>
<p>I want to be perfect, but unfortunately, I'm not a natural.</p>
<p>We're surrounded by people who are close, though.  In day-to-day interactions, we meet a diverse group of people, some of whom are brilliant in some way or another.  Someone is getting the A's in school &mdash; and if I find them, maybe they can help me figure out how to succeed as well.  ~~Some~~A lot of people at the gym can lift heavier weights than me and are a lot more buff &mdash; they're definitely doing something that I'm not.  Some people are hilarious and great to talk to &mdash; how can I be like this?  Hell, someone has got to be dating the hot girls in school.  What are they doing right that I'm doing wrong?</p>
<p>It's not really a mystery, either.  We are each others' best resources, and combined with the internet, there is a plethora of information from which we can learn practically anything.  EdX and Coursera offer actual online classes from top universities about tons of different subjects.  On YouTube, there are hundreds of thousands of instructional videos that can teach you about nearly anything.  And Reddit has strong communities to help support your journey to <a href="http://reddit.com/r/learnprogramming">learn to code</a>, <a href="http://reddit.com/r/fitness">get fit</a>, <a href="http://reddit.com/r/socialskills">become less awkward</a>, and even become <a href="http://reddit.com/r/skincareaddiction">more</a> <a href="http://reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice">attractive</a>.</p>
<p>In life, we're constantly surrounded by people telling us that if we work hard, we can achieve our goals.  There are all sorts of motivational, self-help articles online (<a href="http://oliveremberton.com/2014/life-is-a-game-this-is-your-strategy-guide/">this</a> is one that I particularily liked) that tell us if we just do this or that, if we just buckle down and focus, that we can achieve nearly any of our goals and dreams.  We hold this power in our own hands.  </p>
<p>I beat myself up about this a lot.  If I see people I know who post a new app they created, I feel like shit because I know I spent an hour yesterday scrolling through Facebook.  I know I choose to play League of Legends or watch an episode of TV instead of work on my own side projects.  Every second of time spent poorly makes me feel like shit.  It's my responsibility to become awesome, and wasting time actively slows my progress.</p>
<p>I've talked about how tiger parents with high goals and a results-oriented mindset create successful children.  But, this is in a high-pressure environment that isn't easy to replicate on one's own.  Without the motivation and pushiness of this environment, people can get stressed out because they cannot reach their extremely high standards.</p>
